# EM-Gaussian-Mixture-Model
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm to fit Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) on real-world datasets. It highlights parameter estimation, log-likelihood monitoring, and convergence analysis for effective unsupervised learning.
